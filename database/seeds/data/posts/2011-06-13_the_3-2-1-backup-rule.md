<!-- excerpt -->
Too many people today don't backup their files. And of those that do, many don't
do it well. An easy way to remember a "safe" way to backup your data is with the
"3-2-1 Backup Rule" which goes like this:

  - Keep 3 copies of any important files (your primary/working copy counts as one)
  - Store your files on 2 different media types (Example: Hard drive and in the Cloud)
  - Always have 1 copy off site
<!-- endexcerpt -->

With the 3-2-1 rule you can be relatively confident that you'll always be able
to access your critical data, even after a catastrophic failure.

Another rule I live by when it comes to backup is:

> ## The only good backup is an automatic backup.

If you're backups aren't automated, there's a good chance you'll forget to run
them or (in my case) just be lazy about it and think, "I'll back it up
tomorrow." at which point a failure occurs and you're shit out of luck.

For those of you without a backup plan in place, I'd like to recommend a service
I use, [CrashPlan](http://www.crashplan.com/). CrashPlan allows you to backup to
any of your own computers that also have CrashPlan installed for free. You can
also backup to local folders and external drives and (with a little hacking)
network drives as well. For a (reasonable) price, CrashPlan also supports
limited and unlimited online backup plans. Clients are available for Windows,
Linux and Mac operating systems, so it should work for any system you currently
own. For more info and to download CrashPlan go to <http://www.crashplan.com>.
