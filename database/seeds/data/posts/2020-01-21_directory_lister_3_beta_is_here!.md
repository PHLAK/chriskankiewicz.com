Directory Lister 3 was rebuilt from the ground up both inside and out. The
biggest changes are under the hood including being rebuilt on top of PHP Slim
framework and utilizing PHP-DI to take advantage of modern development
practices. This should make ongoing development much easier and hopefully result
in faster/more frequent updates.

In addition a **brand new theme** (seen above) is front and center featuring
**light and dark modes** to suit your individual needs. The updated theme is
**fully responsive** so it looks and works great on mobile devices. We've also
included out-of-the-box **file search** and **readme parsing** to help people
find the files and information they need quickly. And don't worry, the essential
features of version 2 are still around. Directory Lister 3 remains easy to
install and configure (maybe even easier than v2) with custom sort ordering,
hidden file support and built-in file hashing.

This has been a long time coming and truly wish I could have delivered something
sooner. As the sole developer working on this in my spare time other things
(family, work, life, etc.) have taken priority. However, after several months of
work and preparation I'm confident Directory Lister 3 will deliver a quality
solution for your listing needs as well as become a platform on which to
continue building upon for much time to come.
