My brother is currently attending the DigiPen School of Technology working on a
degree in video game programming / design. He's an avid gamer but has missed
some of (IMO) the best games of all time, specifically, the Half-Life saga.
Naturally, I email him recommending these games in the hope of inspiring him or,
at the very least, giving him a better understanding of some of the good games
he's missed out on and where the industry came from. I even offered to buy the
games for him if he didn't want to pay for them himself. Well, he acquired the
first Half-Life game and started playing it. This was his response:

> Hey Chris, just wanted to let you know that I tried out Half-Life today.  I'm

This got me thinking, most modern games suck. These games are targeted at the
general population, not the avid gamer. The AI are dumbed way down, there are
big signs or floating arrows everywhere telling you which way to go, and the
games are generally too easy. They don't give you a sense of figuring things out
on your own anymore and don't give you a sense of accomplishment. Not to mention
the story of most of these games are boring and do not engage the player. Now
contrast this with the games from our youth. Most of these games were difficult
and many didn't give you any clear path to follow. Here's a list of several
games I enjoyed playing when I was younger.

  * Any Super Mario Bros. Game pre 1990  
  * Battletoads  
  * Duck Hunt  
  * Metroid  
  * Super Metroid  
  * Legend of Zelda  
  * Zelda: A Link to the Past  
  * Zelda: Occarina of Time  
  * Super Mario RPG  
  * Sim Ant  
  * Sim City  
  * Doom  
  * Heroes of Might and Magic  
  * Perfect Dark  
  * Command & Conquer: Red Alert  
  * Star Craft

I could go on. Compared to modern games almost all of these games were
relatively hard, had few if any clear paths to take and some even had things
that would kill you instantly (Bowsers fireballs). Also, many other early NES
games were nearly impossible to beat without the use of cheats or game altering
devices (See the [AVGN](http://www.cinemassacre.com/category/avgn/ "The Angry
Video Game Nerd")). Now think about the countless hours you spent playing these
games and the pure enjoyment you got from playing them. To this day I've never
beaten the original Mario Bros, Battletoads or Metroid, yet I still enjoy
playing them from time to time regardless of their difficulty.

In a world where there's several new (shitty) games out every week and many of
those titles have a sequel released within a year, I truly appreciate game
companies like [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/ "Valve Software") and
[Gearbox](http://www.gearboxsoftware.com "Gearbox Software") and the independent
developers like [Notch](http://www.minecraft.net "Minecraft") and fear for a
future where game developers don't enjoy, or at least respect, the games that
we/they have grown up with.
