Today I wanted to share a small personal accomplishment:

<excerpt>
While working on a project at work it was necessary to interface with the Okta
API for user authentication and authorization. To accomplish this I created, an
independent PHP client library. As it stood there were no
[official](http://developer.okta.com/docs/sdk/core/api.html) or unofficial PHP
libraries available for working with the Okta API and I felt it would be
beneficial to the community, as well as my employer, to publish this library as
an open source project on the company GitHub account. So I talked to some
people, sent some emails and ultimately got the legal department to okay it.
</excerpt>

Thus, I am happy to present OktaSDK-PHP, a PHP client library for the Okta (v1) API.
